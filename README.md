# 📏 Unit of Measurement Converter (Python Mini Project)
## 📌 Project Overview

### This is a simple Python mini project that converts measurements between:

Inches
Feet
Yards

### The program uses:

input() function to collect user input
if-elif-else conditional statements
Basic arithmetic operations
String methods like .lower()
Type casting (int())

This project helped strengthen my understanding of conditional logic and user interaction in Python.

### 🛠️ How It Works

**The user selects:**

Unit to convert from
Unit to convert to

**The user enters the measurement value.**

**The program:**

Validates input using conditional statements
Performs the correct mathematical conversion
Displays the converted result

🔁 Supported Conversions
From	To	Formula Used
```
Inches	Feet	inches ÷ 12
Inches	Yards	inches ÷ 36
Feet	Inches	feet × 12
Feet	Yards	feet ÷ 3
Yards	Inches	yards × 36
Yards	Feet	yards × 3
```

### 💻 Sample Output
```
Enter unit of measurement (inches, feet, yards): inches
Enter unit of measurement to convert to (inches, feet, yards): feet
Enter measurement in Inches: 98

Result: 98 Inches = 8 feet
```
